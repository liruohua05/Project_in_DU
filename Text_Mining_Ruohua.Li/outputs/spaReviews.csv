0,"Contacted them through Yelp and the owner responded right away (though I missed the initial response since Yelp messaging is a bit out of the way).  Was able to book an appointment for the same day (great for us last minute planners!) and they also take walk-ins!  Quick check-in and friendly receptionists - they offered water or hot tea.  They offer a slew of other health and beauty treatments by licensed staff that I'll be interested in trying in the future.  Clean, tasteful, relaxing rooms, with cozy massage tables and super soft linens.  Alicia, my masseuse, listened to exactly what I needed from my massage and was amazing!!  Great for deep tissue and trigger points, also checked in routinely to make sure the pressure was just right.  I'll definitely go back!  Additionally, their location would make it great for walking the mall area after a nice relaxing spa experience.  Parking would be the only hassle I could maybe complain about - which isn't their fault, just part of downtown.  Parked at the mall which cost $18 for the 2 hours I was there - maybe have parking validation or a suggestion for less expensive parking options?",5.0
1,"I had an amazing massage yesterday! I have been dealing with a neck and shoulder injury and was in a lot of pain. I wanted a very relaxing experience but also some help releasing the level of pain I was in. Rachel did such an amazing job! This by far was the best massage I have had in a long time, let alone in Denver. She listened to exactly what I wanted and needed, and made me feel so much better and so relaxed. I left feeling so much better. She covered me in CBD and really helped me to feel like I was doing the right thing. The only thing I would recommend - being someone who LOVES a good massage and full relaxation it would say it would be amazing to add a heating pad (full length of the bed) under the sheets, as it was a little cold in the room with the air on and that would seal the deal and make this a full experience for me. Either way, I will 100% go back to Rachel, and I loved her so much I probably will get a membership so I can be consistent on getting my body back on track!Thanks for the great work!",5.0
2,"Was in town for a work conference and realized we were going to have a few spare hours that afternoon. A co-worker and I decided we desperately needed massages so I went straight to Yelp to find a spot.Fortunately not only was did you guys have openings to accommodate both of us but we're within walking distance of the hotel. Let me tell you, this was the best part of the whole conference!!Prior to our massages we both were complaining about how tight our shoulders were and that we both needed a deep massage. Well neither of us walked out disappointed! Both of us were raving that our massage therapist had to be better than the others because of the focus they paid to our problem areas. Not only that but they each gave us suggestions on what to do in our everyday lives to help alleviate future tension issues.The facility is also clean and the staff is very friendly.We both would highly recommend that anyone in the area, as well as anyone visiting from out of town, stop by if you ever need those kinks worked out. Oh, and they provide so many other services we wished we had time to take advantage of.",5.0
3,My husband and I had the best massage here! I'm picky and it was awesome!  It was the perfect amount of pressure and relaxation. We will absolutely be back!,5.0
4,"I've had a pinched nerve in my neck and serious back and shoulder pain for a few weeks and called and was able to book an appointment for the next day with Alicia (who was highly recommended for these types of injuries).  The receptionist was friendly and helpful and Alicia was excellent.  She was great for deep tissue and trigger points and by the end of the hour I had more mobility in my neck and shoulders than I'd had in a month.  Also, this is just a bit of 16th street so a great option for those of us that work in downtown Denver and need a lunch hour retreat.",5.0
5,Prenatal massage was great! Kate Lynne has strong firm grip. She didn't use too much oil and was able to maintain a firm pressure for the entire session. I would definitely come back here !! She would also be good if you needed sports massage. She had a great intuition and would stay on trigger points until they released!,5.0
6,Called and left a message requesting an appointment and they never bothered to call me back. Very disappointing...,1.0
7,"Had a massage here with my co-worker  since we where both feeling pretty tense and work across the st.  We called and the front desk person that answered was very nice and was able to get us in during our lunch hour.  According to my receipt the person that worked on me was named Danielle, she was awesome ! She made sure to check she wasn't hurting me or putting to much pressure. Best neck and upper back massage I have ever had !  Will defitnetley be doing back at least once a month. 100% recommend.",5.0
8,"Great place for a massage! Have started going almost weekly!  I like Lindsay for massages. She applies the amount of pressure you request and addresses the areas that you want massaged (some spa masseuses tend to follow their own routine, which can be frustrating). I plan to continue regular massages here.",5.0
9,This is my favorite spot in Denver for Massage and Esthetics. This spa is truly one of Denver's hidden gems. I see Lindsay for Massage and she is one of the best therapists I have ever seen. It's so refreshing to be taken care of by true professionals. I'm so glad someone recommended this spa to me.,5.0
10,"I had an excellent treatment - I have chronic muscle pain in my back and my deep tissue massage was incredible. My masseuse was very attentive to my problem areas and was sure to check-in on pressure, temperature, etc. Highly recommend!",5.0
11,"I'm visiting from out of town on a work trip and needed a massage badly. Found this cute spot on yelp and made an appointment for the same day seamlessly. It was clean, warm and welcoming. I had a great massage with CBD cream as an add on and that was amazing in itself! Something felt different from the rest of my massages and after talking with the staff.. i realized it was the CBD that made the difference for me. I'm addicted to it and just booked another appointment 2 days later. I took a star off because the room I was in was not sound really sound proof. I could here people talking. Overall I would recommend this place.",4.0
12,Not the best massage I've ever hadNice people at the front but poor execution Tried to make me feel important at the end when I told them the massage wasn't really great by giving me 30$ off.... thanks for giving my tip back really appreciate it hahaNot coming back and would not recommend,2.0
13,"Great spot for mid day quick massage or the full relaxation experience! They got me in quickly, and the massage therapist Alicia was amazing. The space was inviting, calming and well kept. It was a quiet space and the staff was very nice. I will be back!",5.0
14,"The ladies at the front and my injectionist were amazing! Got juvaderm in my lips for first time and the tox in my forehead and that line that makes you look like you have RBF, im already Russian, I dont need any help making me people think im angry. Love my results, she is a perfectionist and im so happy i got her!",5.0
15,Love this place massage and facial were amazing love love love the staff must try this place,5.0
16,I received an excellent massage here.  I will definitely return.  My sister and I did a little mini spa day here and really enjoyed ourselves.,5.0
17,"Great deep tissue/trigger point massage with CBD lotion.  The ladies at the front desk are very welcoming and helpful.  I had a 60 min. customized massage with added CBD lotion and it was great, felt so much better after having the massage my neck and shoulders finally relax from the traveling. If every in Denver CO again I will make sure to visit again!  Thanks",5.0
18,I simply love love love this place. They are always so courteous at the check in. Kaytlin is the absolute best at deep tissue massages. I refuse to see anyone else because she is that good!,5.0
19,"Not at all a ""spa"" experience. Just a bunch of rooms they do massages in. During my massage I could hear the loud air system kick on and off repeatedly. Not at all able to relax and enjoy the massage.",2.0
20,"I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 only because the front desk (older woman) appeared to not know what's going on. We paid for a couples massage with champagne and when asked she had no clue! A younger woman did step in and fixed everything.However, our therapists Chris and Maria were amazing and the environment is absolutely calming and welcoming. The location is great as you can walk from the 16th street mall strip to here. Thank you for by far the best massage therapists.",4.0
21,Extremely well run Spa with a staff that has a great attention to detail. I have been here a few times and will continue to visit on my trips to Denver.Jess is one of the best masseuses they have. She repaired some badly worn out muscles that were causing me a lot of pain. I highly recommend this place if you are in the area.,5.0
22,Got a couples massage that included hors d'oeuvres and it was so great! I will be returning every year when I visit for Colorado Crossroads.,5.0
23,"I was in Denver with my 2 best friends on a weekend getaway (Denver was the midway point for us between Los Angeles and Wisconsin). Not only were we pleasantly surprised by how much Denver had to offer but I was particularly happy with our experience at Body Massage. I had a fantastic masseuse named Susan who gave a wonderful prenatal massage. At 7 months preggo with a very active toddler, I am pretty much aching all over all the time. This was the first massage I've gotten in almost 3 years and Susan was an absolute expert. Perfect pressure, she was able to identify sensitive areas and try to work on them (I also have scoliosis so am more apt to back pain), and kept the experience very relaxed. She was chatty without being too chatty and regularly checked in with me to make any adjustments. My other friend got a massage (which she said was great) and the other a foot massage (I will say my friend who got the foot massage did mention her masseuse seemed a bit unsure of what he was doing so Body Massage may not be the place if you're looking for reflexology - check in with the schedulers to ensure you get the right person for you). All in all it was a great experience for me and I sure do wish Susan was local to Los Angeles!",4.0
24,"One of the best massages I've ever had! They were super professional, quick to find my problem areas and now I feel like a million bucks!",5.0
25,"We had the package that included a 90 minute massage followed by hors d'oeuvres, champagne (non-alcoholic) and a 'luxury' couples gift bag (included 2 Ferro Rocher's, mini bottle of lotion, hand made guava soap, lavender bath soak, and almond oil).  In the future, I would go with just the massage.  I did not care to check back and see how much more expensive the add on was, but I don't think it was worth the extra cash.Hot cider, water or tea is offered prior to your massage.  Get the cider.  It is delisssssssh!The lobby area as well as the treatment rooms are clean and tastefully decorated.  We were able to get in last minute for a couples massage after a fun experience at the airport (ha!).We each had a good masseuse.  Pressure was spot on and feedback was sought at what felt like appropriate times.  Massage table was warm and cozy and the blankets were super soft.",4.0
26,I was visiting and looked for a place close that could take walk-ins. They had one spot open and welcomed me in quickly. Dani was my therapist and knew what she was doing.  I'd come back again if I lived here!,5.0
27,"Wow! I can't say enough about Dana. She. Was. Awesome. I have had back problems and a surgery and she was so helpful getting me comfortable AND took care to be thoughtful. I ALSO had the wonderful opportunity to have a facial by her. This combo is perfect and really wonderful to have with the same professional. She was incredibly knowledgeable about massage and skin care. I'm so glad I made a day-of appointment here. I'm so fortunate Dana was my masseuse and facial expert. Thank you, Dana!",5.0
28,I have always had great experiences here. I have purchased different services and have been satisfied all times. I really like the M'lis detox products.,4.0
29,"This was me and my partner's first time coming here and it was amazing! The service and experience was great and I'm definitely coming back! We went with the 2.5 hour special that included a 60 minute massage, 30 minute hand massage, and 60 minute facial. Joni did my facial and loved her!",5.0
30,"Scheduled a massage while I was in Denver for a 12 hour layover. They scheduled me within the hour and offered me an awesome special to save me some $$. Once I got there I was offered water and encouraged to relax on the comfy couch. The walls were lined with all kinds of goodies for purchase....lotion bars, tinctures, etc.... I bought a lotion bar which I love. Anyways, once it was time for my massage, I was greeted by Katelyn H. The next hour was AMAZING. Katelyn met my needs and then some. Conversation was great...and usually I prefer silence during the massage. Katelyn is skilled, smart and sweet- she is great at what she does and I truly felt cared for. I was in good hands. Thank you, Katelyn and the team at Body Massage Wellness Spa! I will definetly be back next time I am in Denver...",5.0
31,"While I have yet to get a spa at Body Massage Wellness, their customer service and user friendly website is top-notch. I was on and off phone calls with other local Denver spa locations to try and purchase ~10 gift cards. I was consistently transferred from one person to another to another and was hitting road blocks every where I turned, so many hoops to jump through to just purchase gift cards (and a good amount at that). When I found Body Massage Wellness online, they had a link to ""instant gift certificates"" that was so simple to use  and easy to find. I had one questions, gave the location a call, and the first person I talked to guided me to the solution of my questions within 5 minutes, I was not passed along to anyone, no roadblocks came up, and she gave me a $25 gift card on the phone call as a courtesy. If there spa services are anything like their customer service -- I recommend everyone goes here. Well done!",5.0
32,"What a little hidden gem! My company was kind enough to give each of us IJL girls a spa treatment, and I went with the custom massage. First of all, we usually go to the Brown Palace, but recently we've felt that the service just isn't as good. It's good, but a little weak for the pricing. I need a masseuse with some oomph! After it was booked, I read the previous reviews which were mostly favorable with a few one-offs. Upon walking in, I was slightly bummed that there wasn't a great locker room with lemon water, no fancy bathrobes and slippers, and the front desk lady seemed entirely peeved. Definitely a little lack of professionalism up front. Then along came Mary... My massage therapist. She was pretty and tiny, which I immediately assumed would mean she wouldn't have much ability to really go deep. Let me back up... Always show up about 15 mins prior to your appointment bc you must fill out paperwork. In the paperwork they ask you what type of pressure you like and other massage related preferences. Again, after hundreds of weak massages in my life, I was prejudiced! I totally assumed Mary was going to fall into the light touch category. Boy was I wrong! I asked for a 7 out of 10, and Mary delivered. I probably could have gone with a 6, but with enough breath, it was divine. Heavenly. I have not enjoyed a massage this much in years and years. She was consistent, attentive, strong as heck, but then at the same time gentle. I highly highly highly recommend this spa. Why the 4 stars not 5? ESP bc if anyone follows me they know I'm a comparative yelper!? Well I've touched on parts, but mostly it was the lobby, but I do understand that it's downtown Denver and there's not a lot to work with. BUT... When I walk into a spa I wanna feel I'm in a spa. Wine would be a nice offering, but not required for 5 stars. And the rooms were a little chilly and had sorta weird decor. I still think 4 is pretty good!",4.0
33,"I was in Denver for business after driving across the country to get my son moved in for college. By the time I got to Denver after 4 days of non-stop travel I was tired, stressed and my back and feet were in agony. I found the Wellness Spa and it was just a few blocks from my hotel so I decided to give it a try. All I can say was AMAZING! Garrett worked magic on my back and I walked out pain free and totally relaxed. I will definitely be back the next time I'm in Denver. Everyone was really nice and the rates were reasonable, especially for Downtown Denver.",5.0
34,"While walking by, I stopped in and picked up a brochure. Called shortly after and was able to book the next day. My first concern was that I should not have been able to get in so quickly. I was wrong to be concerned. This wonderful spa has several therapists on hand and a large selection of services. I chose a preferred package and floated out 90 minutes later. Looking forward to returning. Morgan,  FOH, was very helpful. My therapist was Mimi.",5.0
35,"I was in town for a conference and passed this place several times. Finally on the last evening I decided to give it a try. I was initially going to get the 20 min stress buster massage but I was told to come back for the first available spot about an hour, which was fine since I was a walk-in. I came back as asked but the slot had been taken. I was offered a 30 min massage instead 1.5 hours later. Again, since I didn't make an appointment, I agreed to come back. Best decision I made during my Denver trip. My masseuse Amy was wonderful, and was able to do magic in just a short time. She adjusted pressure appropriately and just was very skilled at her job. My only regret is that I didn't have enough time to get a full massage. Thank you so much!",5.0
36,"I was staying at a close by hotel, and being in training all day I needed a massage.  They recommended this one.  I'm glad they did.  They worked me in that day and were professional, friendly, and helped me a lot!  I would definitely go back.  Wish I could get them all the time!",5.0
37,Got a couples massage with the Chandelier package. Honestly staff was great and therapists were communicative. The reason for the 3 stars is based on the value. It was over priced.,3.0
38,I had a great experience here. It's conveniently located in downtown. It's clean and well maintained. My massage was excellent and my masseuse was professional and well trained. Highly recommend.,5.0
39,"Super quick response! Easy to book an appointment, just called a day ahead. Clean and relaxing environment, and the therapists were very responsive to your needs and wants! Definitely would recommend to everyone looking for a relaxing or deep tissue massage!",5.0
40,Great couples massage with aromatherapy & back scrub! Got in last min with no problem! Great location! Such an excellent addition to our vacation!,4.0
41,"This place is incredible. Incredible service and an incredible experience all around. I did the 2.5 Joe spa package and left feeling so relaxed that I shouldn't have been allowed to drive. Maria, my massage therapist, really personalized my experience and took the time to listen to my ails and tailor my experience to them. I will absolutely be returning!",5.0
42,They were pretty decent. I took my mom for a mother-daughter outing and she loved everything about her massage.,4.0
43,"Such a fabulous experience, I clicked a button on the website & someone called back right away.  My facial and deep tissue massage were among the best I've experienced.  Patricia was quick to check in with me to see if the pressure was enough.  I'm a happy girl...",5.0
44,Hands down my favorite massage spot in downtown!!  I've been coming here for over a year and have never been disappointed,5.0
45,"I was staying at the nearby Grand Hyatt and passed by this unassuming place several times on my way to the Convention Center. I was desperately in need of a massage, so based on other Yelp reviews I decided to give it a shot. I was able to book a 90 minute ""Preferred massage"" for the same day.  The staff was courteous and welcoming. My measure of an excellent massage therapist is how well they can locate tense areas and knots without me saying a word.   My massage therapist, Andrew, was phenomenal. He was skilled and sought appropriate feedback throughout on pressure, comfort, etc.  I had no idea I was carrying so much tension in my shoulders!! I highly recommend this place! Request Andrew and you won't be disappointed!",5.0
46,My husby and I did a couple massage and got more than we paid for.  For $170 we got a couple's 60 min massage with aromatherapy and hot towels plus an exfoliating scrub and moisturizer.  The staff was very friendly and even gave us a little gift not t to mention the gift of my neck ache being gone!,5.0
47,"I've been visiting this spa over the past 4-5 years and I have never left less than 100% satisfied. They have a wide variety of specialty massage therapists, so I am always able to get an appointment even if it's last minute. All of the therapists take time to listen to your needs and ensure you get precisely what you want out of the massage session. I also have had the best experience here with laser hair removal! Not only is it affordable, but the experience is quick, efficient and comfortable. I've tried 3 other spas for laser hair removal and will never go anywhere else now that I've gone to Body Massage Wellness. Their laser machines are top of the line, and the staff does a great job of promoting when the spa gets new machines or new techniques. Lastly, I love the products that the spa offers and I never feel pressured to make purchases after I have a service done.  Overall, I love the friendly staff, ease of making appointments, simple text-confirmations, outstanding services (massage, laser hair removal and products) and the reasonable prices of this spa. I recommend this spa to all of my family and friends!!",5.0
48,Eric offered the perfect massage for my stressed out shoulders and traps.He continued to check on the amount of pressure he was using and adjusted well to my muscle tension.  Great chair massage!,5.0

50,"I had Nicholas for a full body therapeutic massage. As a runner, it was one of the best leg massages I've ever had. The additional aromatherapy was a nice, inexpensive enhancement. I will come back here when I come back to Denver",5.0
51,The five star review is garnered by body worker Melissa. My 20 minute chair massage was as thorough as one could be. Wish I had the time for an hour or more on the table. Way to be awesome at your craft Melissa.The establishment itself offers walk-in service and the body work options were totally cost-competitive considering their location in a major metropolitan area.Next time I am downtown with time to bide I will return.,5.0
52,"Fantastic place for a massage, especially if you go to Melissa. My boyfriend and I both go to her, and we both think she's fantastic. She really gets those knots out and stretches your muscles. She did wonders for the salsa- and Krav-Maga-crippled body.",5.0
53,"1. An unclean towel was used used to wipe facial products off my face. I could hear her rinsing the  towel in the sink behind the table I was lying on. After my facial I examined the room to confirm that indeed one towel was repeatedly used to wipe facial products from my face. I observed the sink being used to rinse the towel was not clean. Using an unclean towel from a dirty sink to wipe my face is unhygienic. 2. Facial products were smeared over and into my eye. During facials the eye area is supposed to be avoided with the facial cleansing products. 3. My right eye became irritated and inflamed and swollen due to having facial products smeared over it and into it. This is unacceptable. 4. I had come to the spa there on welton with the idea to relax before my trip home on Friday morning. Instead, my right shoulder was massaged in a rough and harmful manner and resulted in  I severe pain in my right sternocliedomastoid muscle and my right shoulder area. I have took Tylenol for the pain and soaked the shoulder in warm water, and the pain was unrelieved. The LMT pinched the shoulder muscle, and caused the severe discomfort. 5. The facial is described on website as being performed by an experienced person. This is not my experience and instead of returning home relaxed and rested, I needed to go to urgent care for assessment and treatment of right eye inflammation. I regret making the appointment at the spa there on Welton and I resent spending my hard earned money on such substandard service. The manager Houston replied to my complaint in a disingenuous manner and at first offered some complimentary bath salts and later only offered any refund if I would agree to be a ""secret shopper"". What an awful person. Avoid this place. Avoid Kirk, Maria, and Houston. There are better places in Denver.1-2016 - heads up. The owner contacted me through yelp to inquire for more info. Be warned. It was another insincere and unhelpful action. Despite me providing the owner of the with information update, there was still no apology, and not a single effort to address the horrendous experience I had. Be forewarned - this business is low quality and from the individual masseurs, and employees, the manager and even the owner - they are not customer focused or quality focused. If your experience goes well - count yourself lucky- but if your experience does not go well - don't expect them to make it right. They won't, but they will play at making insincere comments and responses on yelp in order to trick future customers from yelp to get sucked in.",1.0
54,Susan gave a fantastic deep tissue massage. Highly recommend her and the spa!,5.0
55,"My wife had the best massage of her life with Chris. We had just finished a 6 day bike tour and her muscles were screaming. Chris was perfect in every way. The front staff was also warm, friendly and professional. Give them a try.",5.0
56,I enjoyed my massage and facial and Susan was great as well as my esthetician but it is definitely over priced. I was expecting some elaborate experience and just did not get that. The hor dourves were that of vending machine quality.,3.0
57,"Place seemed kind of dumpy and just not very clean. People were really nice though. Massage wasn't that great. I had Chris. The massage part was ok but didn't care for the karate chopping. That wasn't relaxing at all. Plus, he moved the table around while I was lying on it in the middle of my massage. Didn't think that was to relaxing either. Cost to much for what it was. Probably wouldn't go back.",3.0

60,"I had a free afternoon on a work trip to Denver and really needed specific work done on my back and hamstring.   I found Body Massage two blocks from my hotel on the Mall and booked a 60 minute massage.... My therapist Tiffany spent a couple minutes getting to know my problem, activity level, and my goals for the session.  I was totally blown away by the time an hour passed.  Tiffany focused on my needs and really nailed the therapy!  Great job Tiffany.... And thank you Body Massage for having a great staff and perfect location for the Denver business traveler.  BV",5.0
61,"I found this place due to proximity of my hotel. I was assigned to Chastity, found her to be very professional, talented and easy to work with. After my 1st session, couldn't get enough that I had to come back for more 2 days later. Chastity is the real deal!",5.0
62,Probably one of the best massages I have ever had. Was sore from running and  Lori worked it out.,5.0
63,"I purchased a laser package via a Groupon/Living social deal and the Shellac mani from crowd savings.  I've found all of the staff to be decently nice overall. Thankfully I didn't have the same experience detailed below with my Shellac mani.  Mine came out well & Thuy was very pleasant to me, but I didn't feel the whole experience was something that rocked my world so much that I would go back there frequently for the service.  So far my laser appointments have been nice, but this is my first experience with it so I don't have much to compare it with.  I did have an appointment where I was stuck in traffic & trying to find a place to park. I called ahead by 15 minutes to let them know I would be a little late due to the traffic. The receptionist never told the gal I had an appointment with that I was running late & she was not real happy with me. She pointed out that ""next time"" I should call ahead.  When I explained to her that was exactly what I did she was more understanding.  The biggest deterrent with this place that would keep me from returning is dealing with parking.  It is virtually impossible to find a spot at a meter, and the lots in the area are very expensive which is a huge aggravation.  Your best bet is to park under Denver Pavillions & just walk over.  The night I was running late for my appointment, there was a concert at the Paramount (which is on the other side of the block) and even the parking lots close by were full which made me more late from having to park further away & I had to pay $10 for a 15 minute appointment. That's just not worth it for me. You almost have to give yourself 30 mins extra time prior to your appointment to make sure you can get a parking spot, & with a meter, you'll be paying extra if you happen to snag one if you get there that early!I would recommend checking out the Lotion bars that they sell!  They are great.",3.0
64,"I have to admit, I am a serial massage therapy client. I go to spa after spa in search of an amazing massage therapist who makes me want to become a return customer. But, Scott, at Body Massage Wellness, may have changed all that! He had a great therapeutic touch and he does neuromuscular massage, sports massage, and reflexology. He was able to identify and treat my problem areas without me prompting him. Great job!Things to know before you go: Body Massage Wellness is downtown so be prepared to search for parking.",5.0
65,This place is amazing and won't disappoint! I get weekly massages and I have to admit this is one of the best places I have found while traveling.  I was in total pain when I arrived and when I left I felt normal.  Jennifer was the best.  I'm going back as much as I can before I leave.,5.0
66,"I was so happy we were able to get a last minute appointment today for a couples massage. It was discounted by 15% (Thanks, Yelp!), so it was a very reasonable $160. I would highly recommend them. Tiffany and Chris are very knowledgeable and attentive to the needs of their clients.",4.0
67,"I received a gift certificate for a massage and mani/pedi at this spa for my birthday. I was very happy with my massage, but would not recommend this place for a mani/pedi.

72,"I bought the lastest waxing/shellac mani/regular pedi combo coupon.  My appointment was rescheduled once due to some one not showing up so that was a little disappointing but they did give me a lot of notice.  I was scheduled a week later. My appt was at 4 which I arrived on time and was not seen until almost 4:30.  No expIanation either, just a ""we'll be with you soon"".  I had to run out to the meter and add money because I was worried about a ticket.The waxing was just OK.  I realized once the redness went away that there was a good deal of hair missed on my lip.  That was a bummer.Thuy did a great job on my toes but the shellac mani is already peeling off my nails and it's only been a week.  the mani took maybe 20 minutes, the pedi about the same.  I felt rushed and not pampered at all.Will not go back nor recommend this place.",2.0
73,"I been going to Body Massage Wellness for several years now! Finally getting around to writing them the review they deserve. Body Massage truly is a gem in the city, an oasis for those of us in the Downtown grind. I have had at least 5 massages and all have been excellent. Dayl in particular is an amazing therapist, able to put me back together after a rough workouts and long hours. I really enjoy the ambiance at Body Massage Wellness, when you walk in you are immediately relieved of stress. They did a great job of creating a relaxing atmosphere. I am always greeted warmly and offered tea or water. The level of attention you receive is on par with any destination spa I have visited. The spa also has a nice range of treatments, facials, herbal tonics to remedy any ailment. Peggy in particular is very knowledgeable and intuitive and was able to get me several treatments that really helped.I haven't tried any of the laser treatments yet but plan to do so in the future! From what I understand they have top of line Zerona lasers.All in all this is my spot to keep me sane and healthy! I can't imagine doing it without them. Their gift cards also make a really nice gift and I regularly buy them for employees and friends as I know they will be well taken care of.Do yourself a favor and schedule an appointment!",5.0

76,"My BFF set up my bachelorette day to include manicures & pedicures for everyone. The package she paid for was supposed to include a cheese & crack platter and a bottle of champagne in our own private room. We were supposed to have 2 - 3 nail techs assisting us 7 girls. Well....... that never happened. Both nail techs were very unprofessional. One was brand new, and the other left an hour before us girls were even finished. The cheese & crack platter never showed and later the girl (admin at the front) said that wasn't actually included in what was booked. My BFF has all of those emails... About 2 hours after we arrived, the champagne finally got there. By that time, 3 of my bridesmaids were on their way out the door to set up for the bigger party at the hotel so we couldn't even really enjoy it together. Throughout our time there, people kept coming into the nail room and sitting in this little make shift nook they have set up. We were asked to ""keep it down"" because massages were being done, even though they knew when the private room was booked that it was a bachelorette party!!! We had to whisper back & forth to each other. It was just very awkward & uncomfortable. The worst part - everyone's nail polish came off within a day. So not worth it!!",1.0

The mani pedi....well, I wouldn't go back for those services.

Not only did she really listen to what my aches were, she worked them intensely but not too intense that I couldn't relax.  I have to say it was the best massage I've ever had!

86,"I received a surprise spa day here thanks to my wonderful husband.   I knew nothing about it before I showed up.  I had one of their packages which included massage, facial, and mani/pedi.  I had just had a massage the day before, and they were very accommodating, letting me swap out the massage for a body wrap. The body wrap was...interesting.  I've had several before.  Never before have I had to stand in a room while someone exfoliated me and then rubbed on the cream. All the body wraps I've done before have been done lying down in a wet room on a table that eventually gets soaked and dirty.  This place, it was done in a facial treatment room.  Alrighty.  After the cream was on, she then basically shrink wrapped me in plastic, and then comedy ensued when we tried to get me on bed for the facial.   But, once I was on the table, it was fine. Note - if you are at all claustrophobic, do not do the body wrap. The facial was fine.  It was relaxing.  It wasn't the greatest one I've had, her massage technique was not great.  It was fine. The mani/pedi was very disappointing.  While I waited (and waited), I kept hearing the person saying how behind she was, what a busy day it was.  I definitely would have guessed that given how rushed she was with me.  It was the fastest pedi I've ever had, no leg massage included...very odd for a fancy spa pedicure.  The manicure was also fast.  She didn't cut my cuticles, which I desperately needed.  When I asked her about it, she said they looked fine, didn't need trimming.  Well, I beg to differ, but I didn't push it since she was so rushed I didn't want to make things worse.  The polish job was fine, but I already see bubbles so I don't hold out hope it will last long. The place was very clean, the people were friendly, but I have to imagine there are better options in Denver.",2.0
87,"My five start rating is based only on my actual massage.  Jeff was my therapist and he was amazing!  I carry all my tension in my neck and shoulders and he was able to rub it all out.  However, the main reason I went in there today was because I had this pain in my ass, literally!  I don't know what I did but I couldn't sit, stand, or bend without this pain in my lower back down toward my leg.  Once he started to massage that area I could actually feel the muscle that I must have pulled being pushed around and back where it should be.  Immediately after the massage I can sit, stand, and bend with no pain.The rest of the staff was friendly, and yes they had a bible verse on the end table in the waiting area, but I didn't care, the massage was amazing!

89,"This is the most unprofessional and worst experience I have ever received. My husband and I were trying to celebrate our 5th anniversary by having a relaxing experience at this ""spa."" If you want to have an extremely unprofessional, awkward, and unrelaxing day at a spa then this is the place for you. I had called this business at the beginning of the day yesterday and told the receptionist that my husband and I were wanting to come in together and get massages and body wraps together to try and have a relaxing day away from the kiddos and had told her about 6 times that we wanted to get the whole experience done together for our anniversary. I had even asked if they had a couples room to do this in and she told me that they did. When we arrived we filled out the paperwork that we needed to and waited to be taken back to our room. After using the restroom we were greeted at a single room by both the massage therapists. One of them said that they were going to have my husband go in the room and that the other was going to take me into a separate room. We then told them that we had told the receptionist that we wanted to do everything in the same room and they then told us to go wait in the lobby and they would get that ready. We should have known at this point to leave. If the receptionist could not understand what I made perfectly clear to her 6 times, she should not be working there. The receptionist and the owner then proceeded to tell us that they could put us in the same room for the massages, but that they would have to put us in separate rooms for the wraps. We then told them that the whole experience was supposed to be done together and that we were not going to do it otherwise. The owner then said that they could do everything in the same room, we would just be wrapped in the body wrap one at a time. Fair enough, we decided to give them the benefit of the doubt and proceed based on the fact that we were going to be able to relax and get everything done together in the same room. We then went into the couples room to get everything started. I have gotten dozens of massages and normal questions about if you are okay and about pressure during the massage are the norm, but that was not the case here. Instead what ended up happening is both the massage therapists talked amongst each other the entire time we were getting the massage. When they started talking to my husband and I about things other than the massage, such as drugs and their personal lives, we tried to casually respond to some of the nonsense that was coming out of their mouths. Not only was this massage not relaxing at all because of all the talking, but the actual massage suffered because whenever they would talk, they would stop massaging to talk. Not only that, but the areas that needed to be focused on didn't even get massaged because of all the chit chat. The massage therapists then talked amongst each other about how much longer the massage was supposed to be for 10 minutes and then proceeded to ask us when they had started massaging us. On top of all that, the therapist that was massaging me quite obviously had not brushed her teeth for the day because the whole time I was on my back I got to smell every word that came out of her mouth and there were far too many words. By the time that was over we were both glad they had exited the room. We were not relaxed, we were weirded out by all the weird things they had decided to discuss during the ""massage"" if it can even be called that. Also during the massage we heard some barking from a dog. Both of the massage therapists laughed and then proceeded to tell us that the owner has a therapy dog that she brings with her to work. I don't see anything wrong with having a therapy dog with you if that's what you need, but to have the dog in close enough proximity to be heard barking while you are trying to relax in a day spa environment? Things can't get any worse right? Wrong.",1.0

91,"I made appointments a week in advance for my husband and I to get mani pedis facials and massages for his 50th Birthday. The gal that answered Cosette answered so fast that should have been a clue that this is NOT a relaxing spa.  Then I got a text confirmation at 1:00 in the morning! Walking in I noticed it wasn't very clean. The front window needs washing, it's cloudy, full of bird poop and it's untidy inside. Then the gal working the desk informs me that one of us can't get a mani and pedi as a tech didn't show up. So my husband got a mani and pedi while I watched (it was his birthday) but the pedi chair didn't massage and the water was put in a thin plastic bucket instead of the nice jets. And the first flimsy bucket leaked, so she had to change it out. She gave me some excuse that throw away liners are for our benefit so we don't get germs.  The tech chomped on her gum the whole time. And then made a few comments about a coworker stressing her out. She clearly hates the other nail tech so I wonder if she is the reason they are short a nail tech. Another nail tech came in and she was very rude to her too. You could feel her disgust at her coworkers. She did say ""They just make me look good""  wow...not really and Not a relaxing place at all! Then we had massages and mine was good. But, they have you fill out a form and on a scale of 1-10 they ask how hard you want the massage. I chose a 3 because I have a bad shoulder and neck. However, my massage was at an 8. My husband didn't feel a thing from his massage and he clearly wished he'd had my therapist as his had no pressure and I ended up buying him another massage later in the week from somewhere else. I doubt they even read the damned survey.Then we went to have facials and I was never more disappointed. I have had many facials and they always use a machine and are very attentive the whole time. This was nothing more than a slathering of lotions by hand. No machine, and your hair full of oil...EVEN in our eyes (which I ended up with pink eye the next day and had to suffer with that for the next five days and it pretty much ruined our hard earned vacation) The tech was busy behind me, doing what I don't know for most of the facial and when I asked my husband he said the same happened to him. He'd never had a facial so he just thought that's what they do. No, this was a BIG WASTE OF MONEY!! and worse than that was a bummer for me to give this as a gift to my husband and get this awful service. Learn from my mistake.",1.0

97,"$80 for an hour ?   I usually pay that much for someone with tons of experience and they work wonders so I was disappointed here.

They were nice, helpful and the place was clean very modern with a lot of services offered.  Although the table was too big for the room and had to be moved quite often during The massage I was able to relax.     Would have been okay for $40 for the hour sorta like a mall quality massage but at $80 plus tip I expect excellent massage technique and the right pressure threw out the massage.    I took one star off for the massage quality and (half if I could ) not doing the hot stone therapy I wrote in,   one for the price and I considered taking one off for being ten mins late but the way the therapist addressed the situation right away and apologized I felt like they do respect people's time and It happens to everyone.

Although, the room set-up wasn't very relaxing, and the head holder wasn't attached very well so it made my neck hurt a little.  There were candles in the room, but none were lit, that would have helped too.  Moving on to the facial, it was alright...I have acne prone skin, and she did pop a few zits, but I thought she would go a little further.  The ceiling also had some water stains on it, which didn't help set the relaxing mood either.Of the 4 things, the facial and massage were my favorite.  The Pedicure....well, let's just say I'd have rather gone to one of those Nail Salons that charges $30!  I sat in a rocking chair, and put my feet in a bucket of water.....NOT AT ALL RELAXING!  They didn't get as detailed as the lower priced salons either, for example, they didn't scrape the dead skin off of my feet bottoms.Then finally there was the manicure...which I sat at a regular table chair across from the tech with about a foot of table between us.  I got the mani on Saturday, and it is Tuesday, and the tips of my fingers are already chipping.Bottom line, I paid $234 for the package, and a tip on top of that....it was not worth it.

108,"Let me preface this review by saying that if I could give zero stars, I would.As a recently converted shellac lover, as well as a deal lover, I jumped when CrowdSavings offered a $19 shellac manicure for this spa. I'm the maid of honor in my friend's wedding this weekend, so yesterday was the perfect time to use it. I booked my appointment a week in advance. When booking, the person never asked what kind of shellac manicure I wanted or if I currently had shellac on my nails. I arrived at my 2:00pm appointment at exactly 2:03pm (parking is a nightmare). I checked in and waited for another 5 minutes before the nail tech, Thuy, came to get me. As she was taking me to the room, she commented on my tardiness. Yes, I admitted I was 3 minutes late, but by making me wait, I'm now 8 minutes late. She told me to choose my color; I let her know that I wanted a French manicure. She rudely told me that I was supposed to have told the girl that when I made the appointment, and she wouldn't have time. I informed her that this was my first time at this spa, so I didn't know, and I wasn't asked. She also sighed heavily when she saw that I already had shellac on my nails. Apparently, I was supposed to have let the appointment girl know in advance. Like I said, this was my first time and I wasn't asked. If it's a huge deal, maybe they should ask these things when setting the appointment. The room was very quiet and relaxing; however, the serenity was lost as Thuy continued to sigh and passively berate me for my tardiness and the fact that she had to remove my old shellac (at one point, she even told me that I was making her late for her next appointment). I stopped at the front desk on my way out, to leave a tip (I may have gotten crappy service, but I always tip), and was told I would be charged ""like, $5"" for taking off the shellac. ""Like $5?"" Like is not an amount. I was so annoyed that I asked the girl if it was actually $5 or a different amount. I paid and got the hell out of there. If I didn't have the wedding this weekend and a coupon, I would have walked out at the first sign of trouble. Looking back, I should have. Pardon me for not being PC, but it looks like Helen Keller did my nails. There are bubbles and blemishes on at least three nails. The color is atrocious. I considered calling and complaining, but I do not want to deal with this place ever again. I don't want this person to berate me while she fixes this mess and I doubt I can get my money back on a coupon. The money I saved on the coupon will now be going elsewhere so someone better can fix my nails.",1.0

The receptionist told me that they had a couples room so we could do this, so I booked the appointment. She told me that my husband's massage therapist was going to do his massage and his wrap and that I would have a massage therapist for my massage and an esthetician doing my wrap.

They try to put us in separate rooms, then they offer for us to be in the same room for the massages, but not for the wraps. When we tell them that we had specifically told them we wanted to be together for the whole thing, the receptionist started arguing with me about it.  I told her 6 times that we wanted to be together in a couples room, if you cannot accommodate that, you shouldn't lie to someone to get them in the door and tell them that you can. Then, the owner says that we can be in the same room, we will just be wrapped in the body wrap one at a time.  Fair enough, we decided to continue based on the fact that we were going to get to relax in the same room as was specified to the receptionist.  Big mistake! I have gotten dozens of massages and the norm for talking is asking if the pressure is okay during the massage, other general questions are asked before you get the massage to ensure relaxation, that was not the case here.  Instead, both of our massage therapists decided to talk about drugs and their personal lives the whole entire massage.  I assume they were friends, talking about how one was more weird than the other and about just general weirdness. In order to be polite, we would casually respond to some of what they said so that maybe at least our massage would be good. That didn't happen either. When they would start talking, they would stop massaging and I guess my husband's massage therapist was so busy that she wasn't paying any attention at all because she was putting some much pressure on him that she bruised him. So, not only was the massage not relaxing, but we actually didn't even really receive the massage. Next, the wraps suffered because my husband's massage therapist went home and now the woman doing our wraps has to do us both.  What wasn't told to us at this point was that our wrap experience was going to suffer! Had someone told me that our time was going to be wasted due to their error, the massage was going to be terrible, then we were going to lose out on our foot reflexology massage (which is part of what you are paying for during the wrap), we NEVER would have came here. Instead the owner and her staff lied to us to convince us to spend $425 here. When we brought all of this to the attention of the owner she told us that the massage therapists shouldn't have talked during the massage and she offered a discount on our next massages. When we called the next day to explain that our whole experience suffered and that they wasted 2 hours of our time on their error and that it made us miss our anniversary dinner, she was extremely rude over the phone. She tried to give us the run around all day and after all of that, she offered us $16 of the $425 we spent! He then told her that we were going to make sure that everyone knew about our terrible experience and she immediately offered $108. My husband went in to speak to her because that didn't even cover the massages, let alone everything else that went wrong. He asked her if she would provide complimentary services to make the situation right and she said no. I guess she must have no faith that her staff can provide relaxing, adequate service. We will be advising our family, friends, and business contacts that are looking for a spa to go elsewhere. We advise anyone reading this to do the same. There are plenty of other businesses that will stand by their work, and if they make a mistake, they will fix it. The owner and her staff here DO NOT STAND BY THEIR WORK, and when something goes wrong, they try to avoid it and do nothing about it.",1.0
116,I love this place! The staff is friendly and the treatments are affordable. Dr. Irwin was very helpful when I was deciding if I should get Botox. She explained the Pros and Cons and how the procedure was done. She made me feel confident in my decision to take the plunge! And boy am I glad I did......I love my results and I will definitely continue treatment!!!,5.0
117,"I bought a Living Social laser package for 6 treatments. Although I scheduled my appts with the same technician I had 5 different technicians for 6 treatments. The first 3 were nice and professional. The fourth one was awful. She said the prior three technicians didn't know what they were doing, did the laser treatments incorrectly and if I wanted the treatments to actually make a difference I would need to buy at least 3 more treatments. On my final visit I had yet another technician who was nice but tried to up sell me with another $800 laser package. I feel like this place has a lot of inconsistencies and turnover. The parking is a nightmare but that's to be expected downtown. Even with another deal I wouldn't go back.",2.0
118,Julia is AMAZING!!!  I had bad lower back pain for 5 weeks and she fixed it in 60 minutes.  I'll be going back for sure!,5.0
119,"I just tried this place after walking past it a million times.  I finally got tired of my muscles and walking around like Igor.  I had Courtney, who was young and petite, but with very strong hands.  I took 15 minutes out of my day to only to walk out feeling brand new.  I don't know why I don't do this more often.  The price is even better - $15 for 15 minutes.  I tipped her $5.  You can't schedule a 15 min., only walk in, but if you call beforehand, they'll let you know what the schedule is like.  I agree with Shiho, not for wedding parties or anything truly spa-like, but for a 15 minute feel better massage, this place is awesome!  I am a bit biased, it is 1/2 a block from my work!",5.0
120,"I went in for waxing services, and while they are not quite as good as Wax in the City, I think it's not because of technique but because of product.  It's not their bread and butter work, the massages and spa services in general are, but was very adequate and they were able to fit me in with only a day's notice as opposed to a week's wait at Wax in the City.  Average downtown pricing, and because I was a new customer, they also gave me 10% off my first services!  Based on other reviews, I'll definitely amend mine...as I certainly plan on going back and indulging in a massage!",3.0
121,This is your average day spa with decent customer service and a plethora of services on the menu.  I wouldn't recommend this place for any wedding party services or for party favors for a Bachelorette Party but would def. recommend this place for those who enjoy a manny/peddy after work or a little massage to wind down.   Getting pampered definitely takes you to a peacful place but unfortunately Body Massage Center does not help yo get their with their atmostphere.,3.0
122,"This was my first 1 1/2hr massage and I loved it. I was in town for a conference and walked in. They had same day appointments which impressed me for such a nice place. My friends kind of poked fun at me since the shop had a few Bible quotes up, but a massage is a massage.  I had a female therapist who I think was named Chelsey. When I got up after the wonderful deep tissue massage I saw all this gray stuff on me and the bed. When I asked her about it she told me it was dead skin. I was so embarrassed, but I think it was pretty awesome that she dealt with my out-of-town dry skin. I give this place 4 stars because it was great service, but a little pricey.",4.0
123,"I went in to get Shellac done with Thuy.  She was very pleasant, I enjoyed chatting with her.  In doing my nails, she realized that 1 didn't dry very well, and even though she was completely done with all the rest, she still went back and redid that 1.  I definitely appreciate the attentiveness.  Overall though, the nail polish didn't cover the nail completely, didn't go all the way down to the skin, and a couple corners were sloppy.  I saw that she tried hard and may I'm just very picky with the way my nails look.  I'm happy with shellac, it's my first time trying it, but I wouldn't go back to this salon.",3.0
124,"This was my first time to this spa and i was very impressed. The receptionist was very friendly, welcoming and had a good sense of humor that lightened up a stressfull day. She reminded me of a girlfriend from college. N -E - way, I recieved a 90 min hot stone massage with Jeff and it was far and away the best massage I've had in years! Way better than the spa's I've been to in Beaver Creek and Vail. Im very glad I chose to come to Body Massage Wellness Spa, I will be seeing you all next month. Thank you again for a wonderful afternoon  :-)",5.0
125,"Love this place! Very nice ambiance and relaxing atmosphere! Staff was friendly and helpful! Megan gave me a top rated massage and much medical insight! When she was finished I moved immediately to a cute waiting area and soon after began a wonderful pedicure by Maria! She really worked hard on my calluses! She sold me on the Shellac manicure. I was a little leery at first, but I can now see that it truly is the 14 day manicure that she sold me! Will be going back soon!",5.0
