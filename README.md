## Description

### Final Project
there are 3 files under the folder, including code, dashboard, and dataset.

this is the final project in my R class, i tried to use the bank dataset to analyze the feature of customers who attend this bank campaign, not only using the association rule, but also using various decision trees.

the highlight in this project is I use R to make a very nice dashboard that I can look around. The layout and the explaination are very clear and easy to understand.

the conclusion in this project focuses on the results from different decision trees, which parameter and what kind of trees I should use to predict the result much better, but does not pay attention to the recommendation in business perspective. Obviously, digging into the business value from this analysis is the things I need to do as a business analyst, so besides the conclusion in this project, I also think about if I work in this bank, what recommendations should I give.
